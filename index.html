    I am currently pursuing my 'Graduate Marine Engineering' course from <a href="https://www.aema.edu.in/">AEMA</a>.My Projects focused on the issue of Energy shortage and inadequate distribution of energy resources during off peak and peak hours.
    The project Titled <strong><a href="C:\Users\shubh\Desktop\web development\HTML - MY SITE\Final Project Report (T -50).pdf">Study of Thermal Transport Properties of Carbon Based NFPCM (Graphene) For CTES Applications</a></strong> was a part of my
    final year project in <strong>2022</strong> and <em>the main objective <br>
      of this project was <strong>to develop a graphene nanoparticle enhanced phase change material and improve its thermophysical properties which when coupled with a CTES system , can reduce the total solidification time, subcooling time and
        enhance the cooling rate in order to improve the overall efficiency of the <a

    I am also the treasurer for <em><a href="https://ishrae.in/Home/about_ishrae">ISHRAE</a>- Chennai chapter</em> and have a keen interest in Thermal Engineering domain. I have also recieved
    <strong><a href="C:\Users\shubh\Desktop\web development\HTML - MY SITE\scholarship.pdf">Academic Scholarship</a></strong> for
    my academic performance in my 3rd year of Btech.
